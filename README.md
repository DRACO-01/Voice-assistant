# Voice-assistant
This Python script creates a voice-controlled assistant using speech recognition and text-to-speech. Triggered by “Friday,” it sends WhatsApp messages, searches Wikipedia, opens websites, runs apps, shuts down the system, and interacts with Instagram and Udemy. It secures sensitive data with environment variables.
